## The Inner Workings of our Government

    Everything is run by *The Coalition*. The US is still techincally a democracy but only techincally. All the elections are controlled by *The Coalition*. They always have a candidate of their own. *The Coalition* runs the campaign, censors anything from opposing candidates, and plasters propaganda everywhere. Every politician in Washington is in their pocket.
